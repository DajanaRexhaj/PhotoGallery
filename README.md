# PhotoGallery
A simple photo gallery with some features for the purpose of practicing HTML CSS and JS

This is a project I started on my own as a form to practice some basic knowledge on html css and js. 
Here are displayed some random photos from my pinterest feed. As options I have added an about 
page as a static one just to practice some css elements. Then I added a customize option for the user to 
choose the background color of the main page. Followed by an add more option (not done yet) and a simple login/register page.
