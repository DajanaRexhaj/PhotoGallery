                <h2>What you need to know...</h2>
                <p>This website is being built for the purpose of practicing HTML CSS and JS. I am trying
                    to add as many elements as I can to make a functional and responsive page online. Some 
                    of the elements used, I have learned in previous internships or online courses, the others
                    are new information which I have found online in youtube or else where. 
                </p>
